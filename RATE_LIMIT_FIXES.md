# Rate Limit Fixes Applied

## ✅ Changes Made to Prevent Rate Limits

### 1. **Python Function Format Fixed**
- ✅ Removed problematic `default = handler` export
- ✅ Vercel now properly detects the handler function
- **Fixes:** 401 authentication errors

### 2. **Batch Size Reduced**
- **Before:** 20 products per batch
- **After:** 10 products per batch
- **Benefit:** Less simultaneous requests = lower chance of rate limits

### 3. **Increased Delays Between Batches**
- **Before:** 10 seconds fixed delay
- **After:** Exponential backoff starting at 20 seconds
  - Batch 1: 20 seconds
  - Batch 2: 25 seconds
  - Batch 3: 30 seconds
  - ... up to max 60 seconds
- **Benefit:** Gradually increases delays to prevent hitting limits

### 4. **Delays Between Products**
- **Added:** 2 second delay between products within a batch
- **Benefit:** Prevents overwhelming APIs with rapid requests

### 5. **Increased Base Translation Delays**
- **Before:** 1000ms (1 second)
- **After:** 2000ms (2 seconds)
- **Benefit:** More time between translation requests

### 6. **Increased Chunk Delays**
- **Before:** 200ms between text chunks
- **After:** 1000ms (1 second) between chunks
- **Benefit:** Prevents rapid-fire chunk translations

### 7. **Better Error Handling**
- ✅ Detects 401 errors (authentication)
- ✅ Detects 429 errors (rate limits)
- ✅ Exponential backoff on retries (5s, 10s, 15s... up to 30s max)
- ✅ Better error messages

### 8. **Rate Limit Detection**
- ✅ Checks for 429 status codes
- ✅ Automatically waits longer before retrying
- ✅ Falls back gracefully if all services are rate limited

## 📊 New Timing Structure

### Per Product Translation:
```
Product 1: Translate → Wait 0s
Product 2: Translate → Wait 2s
Product 3: Translate → Wait 2s
...
Product 10: Translate → Done
```

### Between Batches:
```
Batch 1 (10 products): Done
  → Wait 20 seconds
  
Batch 2 (10 products): Done  
  → Wait 25 seconds
  
Batch 3 (10 products): Done
  → Wait 30 seconds
  
... (increases up to 60s max)
```

### Translation Requests:
- **Base delay:** 2 seconds between requests
- **Chunk delay:** 1 second between text chunks
- **Retry delay:** 5-30 seconds (exponential backoff)

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Before Fixes:
- ⚠️ Hit rate limits after 4 pages (80 products)
- ❌ 401 errors on Python API
- ❌ 429 errors on all fallback services
- ❌ No translations happening

### After Fixes:
- ✅ Slower but more reliable
- ✅ Should handle 100+ products without hitting limits
- ✅ Exponential backoff prevents sudden rate limit hits
- ✅ Better error recovery

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Processing will be SLOWER**
   - This is intentional to avoid rate limits
   - Expected: ~2-3 minutes per product (with delays)
   - For 4400 products: Will take much longer, but should complete

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Watch console logs for rate limit warnings
   - If you see multiple 429 errors, delays will automatically increase

3. **If Still Hitting Limits**
   - Further reduce batch size (5 products)
   - Increase base delays even more
   - Consider using Yandex API (higher limits)

## 🔧 Configuration

You can adjust these via environment variables:
```bash
TRANSLATION_DELAY=2000        # Base delay (default: 2000ms)
TRANSLATION_CHUNK_DELAY=1000  # Chunk delay (default: 1000ms)
```

## 📝 Summary

**Key Changes:**
1. ✅ Fixed Python function format (removed `default = handler`)
2. ✅ Reduced batch size: 20 → 10
3. ✅ Increased delays: 2s between products, 20-60s between batches
4. ✅ Exponential backoff on retries
5. ✅ Better rate limit detection and handling

**Result:** Slower processing but much more reliable, should avoid hitting rate limits!
